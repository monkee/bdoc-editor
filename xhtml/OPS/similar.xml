Adventures in Wonderland</em></a>
<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is a novel written by
English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known under the
pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice
who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy world populated by
peculiar and anthropomorphic creatures.<br />
The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and
enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were
expected to memorize. The tale plays with logic in ways that have
made the story of lasting popularity with adults as well as
children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic
examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative
course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the
fantasy genre.</p>

Three Musketeers</em></a>
<p>The Three Musketeers (Les Trois Mousquetaires) is a novel by
Alexandre Dumas, père. It recounts the adventures of a young man
named d'Artagnan after he leaves home to become a musketeer.
D'Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his
friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis—inseparable friends who live by
the motto, "One for all, and all for one".<br />
The story of d'Artagnan is continued in Twenty Years After and The
Vicomte de Bragelonne. Those three novels by Dumas are together
known as the D'Artagnan Romances.<br />
The Three Musketeers was first published in serial form in the
magazine Le Siècle between March and July 1844.</p>

<p>Dracula is an 1897 novel by Irish author Bram Stoker, featuring
as its primary antagonist the vampire Count Dracula.<br />
Dracula has been attributed to many literary genres including
vampire literature, horror fiction, the gothic novel and invasion
literature. Structurally it is an epistolary novel, that is, told
as a series of diary entries and letters. Literary critics have
examined many themes in the novel, such as the role of women in
Victorian culture, conventional and conservative sexuality,
immigration, colonialism, postcolonialism and folklore. Although
Stoker did not invent the vampire, the novel's influence on the
popularity of vampires has been singularly responsible for many
theatrical and film interpretations throughout the 20th and 21st
centuries.</p>

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em></a>
<p>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (often shortened to Huck Finn) is
a novel written by American humorist Mark Twain. It is commonly
used and accounted as one of the first Great American Novels. It is
also one of the first major American novels written using Local
Color Regionalism, or vernacular, told in the first person by the
eponymous Huckleberry "Huck" Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer and
hero of three other Mark Twain books.<br />
The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places
along the Mississippi River. By satirizing Southern antebellum
society that was already a quarter-century in the past by the time
of publication, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched
attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and
his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on
their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and
freedom in all of American literature.</p>

Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em></a>
<p>This story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the
effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the
beginning and the worst part at the end. By trying the experiment
upon only one man in a perfectly normal world I have scarcely given
his idea a fair trial. Several weeks after completing it, I
discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's
"Note-books."<br />
The story was published in "Collier's" last summer and provoked
this startling letter from an anonymous admirer in
Cincinnati:<br />
"Sir--<br />
I have read the story Benjamin Button in Colliers and I wish to say
that as a short story writer you would make a good lunatic I have
seen many peices of cheese in my life but of all the peices of
cheese I have ever seen you are the biggest peice. I hate to waste
a peice of stationary on you but I will."</p>

<p>Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, generally known as
Frankenstein, is a novel written by the British author Mary
Shelley. The title of the novel refers to a scientist, Victor
Frankenstein, who learns how to create life and creates a being in
the likeness of man, but larger than average and more powerful. In
popular culture, people have tended to refer to the Creature as
"Frankenstein", despite this being the name of the scientist.
Frankenstein is a novel infused with some elements of the Gothic
novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the
"over-reaching" of modern man and the Industrial Revolution,
alluded to in the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus. The
story has had an influence across literature and popular culture
and spawned a complete genre of horror stories and films. It is
arguably considered the first fully realized science fiction
novel.</p>
