<p>Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet OM (9 May 1860 â€“ 19 June
1937), more commonly known as J. M. Barrie, was a Scottish novelist
and dramatist. He is best remembered for creating Peter Pan, the
boy who refused to grow up, whom he based on his friends, the
Llewelyn Davies boys. He is also credited with popularising the
name "Wendy", which was very uncommon before he gave it to the
heroine of Peter Pan. He was made a baronet in 1913; his baronetcy
was not inherited. He was made a member of the Order of Merit in
1922. Source: Wikipedia</p>
